Gratling the HTML5 contenteditable table
====

A little experiment to see if HTML5 has come far enough to create editable tables that behave like spreadsheets with respect to navigation.

You can use the usual keys - ENTER, TAB, SHIFT-TAB to navigate. You can also use the arrow keys, but you need to hold down CONTROL or COMMAND (Apple).

Knockoutjs rocks, and I've used it to pump data into the table, and organise my code using the MVVM pattern - but it isn't strictly required for this demo.
